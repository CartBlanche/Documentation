Meadow.Foundation greatly simplifies the task of building connected things with Meadow, by providing a unified driver and library framework that includes drivers and abstractions for common peripherals such as sensors, displays, motors, and more. Additionally, it includes utility functions and helpers for common tasks when building connected things.

It's completely [open source](https://github.com/WildernessLabs/Meadow.Foundation) and we welcome pull-requests!

## Hello, World Example

With Meadow.Foundation, you can use drivers and hardware abstractions directly, for example, instead of using an `IDigitalOutputPort` class, an LED can be driven by the the [`PwmLed`](/docs/api/Meadow.Foundation/Meadow.Foundation.Leds.PwmLed.html) class, using high-level methods such as `StartBlink()`, `StartPulse()`, and more.:

```csharp
using System.Threading;
using Meadow;
using Meadow.Foundation;

public class HelloBlinky
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        var pwmLed = new LEDs.PwmLed(
            App.Device.D01, 
            LEDs.TypicalForwardVoltage.Green);

            // pulse the LED
            pwmLed.StartPulse();

            // keep the app running
            Thread.Sleep(Timeout.Infinite);
    }
}
```
